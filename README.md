Welcome to the Mini Oscilloscope project repository! This project aims to develop a mini oscilloscope using the STM32F4 microcontroller. The oscilloscope utilizes a Timer Input Capture Unit (ICU) and Timer to generate Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signals. Additionally, it incorporates an LCD to showcase the signal frequency and width, providing a user-friendly interface for real-time monitoring.

### Features:
- **STM32F4 Microcontroller**: The project is developed specifically for the STM32F4 microcontroller, offering high performance and reliability.
- **Timer ICU and Timer for PWM**: Utilizes Timer Input Capture Unit (ICU) and Timer to generate Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signals, enabling precise measurement and control of signals.
- **LCD Display**: Integrates an LCD to showcase signal frequency and width, providing real-time monitoring capabilities.
- **Firmware Development**: The firmware is developed using optimized techniques to ensure optimal performance and accuracy.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A user-friendly interface for easy interaction and monitoring is offered.

### Getting Started:
To get started with the Mini Oscilloscope project, follow these steps:

1. **Hardware Setup**: Connect the STM32F4 microcontroller to the necessary peripherals including the Timer Input Capture Unit (ICU), Timer, and LCD.
   
2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/the7ag/STM32F4_MINI_OSCILLOSCOPE.git
   ```

3. **Compile and Flash**: Compile the firmware and flash it onto the STM32F4 microcontroller using your preferred toolchain.

4. **Run the Oscilloscope**: Power on the mini oscilloscope and start monitoring signals in real-time using the LCD.
